# Anomaly-Detection
Final Year project of anomaly detection in surveillance images, gifs.

To run the code of anomaly detection please follow these steps.

1)  Create new kaggle notebook.
2)  Copy the code cell by cell given in (Anomaly_detection.ipynb) file and paste in kaggle environment.
3)  Load the dataset of UCF-crime on Kaggle which is already present in kaggle itself.
4)  Then train the model (in case if you don't want to train model then take pretrained model[download it with pretrained_model_link.txt] which is uploaded on github).
5)  After loading dataset and model then run cell by cell in kaggle.
6)  You can upload any random image and gif of (Abuse Arrest,Robbery,Explosion,Fighting,Shooting only) from internet.
7)  Or you can use the test images which is already given in the dataset.
8)  check results and if it is not matching properly then contact me via email(My email: bt19ece013@iiitn.ac.in).
